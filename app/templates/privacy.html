<h1>Nano Privacy</h1>
Please read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/8kljqo/saturday_discussion_privacy/">this discussion</a> on Nano privacy if you'd like to see all the opinions<span class="citation">reddit_discussion</span>.
<h2>Nano can be very private through rolling wallet addresses and mixers.</h2>
Wallet level privacy will come through the use of rolling Nano addresses<span class="citation">reddit2</span>. Since Nano is instant and has
no transaction fees, they can be used with any small amount of Nano, never leaving dust behind. Further, 3rd party mixers
can conceal addresses.
<h2>Every Nano "privacy fork" is a scam.</h2>
Please don't give any money to ICOs for them.
